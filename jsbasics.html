            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oreinted scripting language. JavaScript is extremely populat for a variet of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to probide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><u id="lightblue">Variable Declaration</u> JavaScript variable are containers for storing datat values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <em id="blue">var x;</em></li>
                <li><u id="lightblue">Variable Assignment</u> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <em id="blue">var x = 10;</em></li>
                <li><u id="lightblue">Data Types</u> Data types are an important concept to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean -<em id="blue">true</em> or <em id="blue">false;</em> null - <em id="blue">null</em> aka nothing; Number - <em id="blue">42</em> or<em id="blue"> 3.14159</em> String - <em id="blue">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</em> Array -<em id="blue"> [1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</em> and Object - <em id="blue">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</em></li>
                <li><u id="lightblue">Conditionals</u> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statemtents: <em id="blue">if</em> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code black; <em id="blue">else if</em> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false;<em id="blue"> else</em> we execute this block of code;</li>
                <li><u id="lightblue">Loops</u> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!</li>
                <li><u id="lightblue">Function</u> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example, imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
